## How should I use it? (Three options for you to choose from)

### Option A: CLI (Recommended)

The best and most flexible way to use it is to use our CLI in the terminal. You can create and check your solutions using three core commands: `lk`, `lf`, and `lc`.

[Installation](<#I-Global-Installation-of-CLI-(Option-A)>) · [Usage](#using-cli)

### Option B: Fork (Supported)

You can also use GitHub's fork feature to create a copy of our project. Then, you can directly use the built-in commands within the project to create and check solutions.

[Installation](<#II-Fork-the-Repository-to-Create-Your-Own-leetcode-practice-Repository-(Option-B)>) · [Usage](#using-the-forked-project)

### Option C: Plugin (Supported)

You can also use our `leetcode-practice` plugin available in the plugin marketplace for interactive creation and checking of solutions. (Supported on two popular editors: `WebStorm` and `VS Code`)

## Usage

### Using CLI

#### 1. Creating Solutions - `lc`

##### [1]. Get Today's Problem - [`-t`/`--today`]

Type `lc` in the terminal to get today's problem in the current working directory by default.

```shell
lc
# Full command
lc -t
```

Example of getting today's problem:

```shell
# For example, the current execution directory is src
➜  src git:(dev) ✗ lc
MODE: today
Successfully obtained problem [2867.Count the Number of Valid Paths in a Tree]!
Problem file address is: /home/wh131462/workspace/leetcode-practice/src/2867.count-valid-paths-in-a-tree/index.js
```

##### [2]. Get Specified Problem - [`-i`/`--identity`]

Type `lc` followed by the corresponding problem number in the terminal to get the specified problem in the current working directory.

```shell
lc 1314
# Full command
lc -i 1314
# Use double quotation marks (") to ensure accurate identification, especially for problem numbers with spaces
lc -i "LCP 50"
```

Example of getting problem `LCP 50`:

```shell
➜  src git:(dev) ✗ lc "LCP 50"
MODE: identity
Successfully obtained problem [LCP 50.Supply of Jewel]!
Problem file address is: /home/wh131462/workspace/leetcode-practice/src/LCP 50.WHnhjV/index.js
```

##### [3]. Get Random Problem - [`-r`/`--random`]

Type `lc` followed by the `-r` parameter in the terminal to get a random problem in the current working directory. It will prioritize obtaining problems not currently in the directory.

```shell
# Full command
lc -r
```

Example of getting a random problem:

```shell
➜  src git:(dev) ✗ lc -r
MODE: random
Successfully obtained problem [14.Longest Common Prefix]!
Problem file address is: /home/wh131462/workspace/leetcode-practice/src/14.longest-common-prefix/index.js
```

##### [5]. Easy Creation Mode (Interactive Creation) - [`-e`/`--easy`]

In addition to creating problems quickly with precise commands as mentioned above, you can also use easy creation mode for interactive creation.

```shell
lc -e
```

Example of creating today's problem using easy mode:

```shell
➜  src git:(dev) ✗ lc -e
? Select the problem creation mode: today
? Create the problem [ 2867.count-valid-paths-in-a-tree ] in the directory [ /home/wh131462/workspace/leetcode-practice/src ]? Yes
Problem [2867.count-valid-paths-in-a-tree] created!
File address is: /home/wh131462/workspace/leetcode-practice/src/2867.count-valid-paths-in-a-tree/index.js

```

#### 2. Checking Solutions - `lk`

##### [1]. Check Today's Solution [`-t`/`--today`]

Type `lk` in the terminal to check today's solution in the current working directory.

```shell
# By default, check today's solution
lk
# Full command
lk -t
```

Example of checking today's solution:

```shell
# Specified src directory as the root directory
workspace/leetcode-practice [dev●] » lk -d src -t
MODE: today
Check result for problem [2581.Count Possible Trees]:
```

#### 3. Problem Lookup - `lf`

To be developed...

##### [1]. View Problem List [To be developed]

#### 4. Common Parameters

##### [1]. Get or specify the current programming language - [-l/-language [language]]

You can use -l without arguments to get the current programming language setting, or you can specify the language parameter to set the language environment of the current CLI to the specified language.

```shell
# This parameter behaves consistently in lc/lk/lf
lc -l
lk -l java
```

Usage example:

```shell
# Get language environment
➜  leetcode-practice git:(dev) ✗ lc -l
Current CLI language environment is: javascript
# Change language environment
➜  leetcode-practice git:(dev) ✗ lc -l java
? Please confirm the language environment you want to set for the CLI (Press Enter to confirm if the option matches) java
Setting language environment to: java
```

Note: Unable to execute test cases in this environment.

##### [2]. Specify Directory - [`-d`/`-directory`]

The `create` and `check` commands can also use the `-d` parameter to specify a relative address based on the current working directory as the specified directory.
When specifying a directory, the operation will be performed in that directory.

```shell
# Use the src directory as the generation directory
lc -d src -t
# Use the src directory as the check directory
lk -d src -i
```

Example:

```shell
➜  src git:(dev) ✗ lc -d src -t
MODE: today
Successfully obtained problem [2867.Count the Number of Valid Paths in a Tree]!
Problem file address is: /home/wh131462/workspace/leetcode-practice/src/src/2867.count-valid-paths-in-a-tree/index.js
```

> Note: If the specified directory does not exist, an empty directory will be created.

##### [3]. Check Version [`-V`/`--version`]

```shell
# Check lc version
lc -V
# Check lk version
lk -V
# Check lf version
lf

 -V
```

Example of checking the lc version:

```shell
workspace/leetcode-practice [dev●] » lc -V
0.0.0
```

##### [4]. Update Check [`-u`/`--update`]

Using the `-u` or `--update` parameter, you can check whether the current version is the latest version. If the current version is not the latest version, you will be prompted whether to update.

```shell
lk -u
lf -u
lc -u
```

```shell
? Automatically detected environment is [ project ], if not, please make a selection, if yes, please press Enter to confirm. project
Start getting version number in npm repository...
Successfully obtained version number in npm repository!
Start getting version number in github repository...

? Detected [ project ] can update to version[ 1.0.1 ], whether to update? (Y/n) Yes
Update completed~Enjoy your use~
```

### Using the Forked Project

#### [0]. Dependency Installation

Before using, install dependencies using a package manager.

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Or use yarn (you can use any package manager you like)
yarn
```

The commands in the forked project are the same as those in the CLI usage parameters, except that the scripts are executed through the package manager such as `npm run`.

> Note: The only difference between the scripts in the project and the scaffolding is that the `-d` parameter is specified by default, pointing to the `src` directory at the root of the project, so all commands are executed by default in `src`.
